# AWS_EXTRA_HEADER
A Chrome extension that adds an extra header bar on top of native navigation bar

## Features
This extension will give you extra header bar on top of native AWS navigation bar.  
You can distinguish the separate account easily by icon, color and message.
This will prevent you from operating at wrong account.

## Requirement
This extension is tested on Chrome 86.0.4240.193（Official Build） （x86_64） on max OS 10.15.7.  
It may not function properly on other browsers, versions, OSs or even on same environment.  
I will try to catch in date with any updates on browsers or AWS console, but it may take some time.  

## Installation
Link to the chrome extension store will be shown here after the approval process.  

## Usage
1. Access to AWS console
 - This will add your account alias and username/role to the config file.

2. Edit color in option option page
 - The color will be generated randomly.
 - If you don't like it, change it.
 - Add some comments if needed.

 3. Ta-dah!


## Note
Letters in option page must match exactly with AWS accounts and username/role.(Incld. Capital Letters).
You can type manually in the option page, but I would recommend to access the AWS console first because this extension will copy the letters for you.
